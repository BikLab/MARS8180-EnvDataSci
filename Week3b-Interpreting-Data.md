### Week 3b Bioinformatics Decision Points

_No amount of high-end bioinformatics can compensate for poorly prepared samples and it is therefore imperative that careful attention is given to sample preparation and library generation within workflows, especially those involving multiple PCR steps._

* Quote from Murray et al 2015, From Benchtop to Desktop: Important Considerations when Designing Amplicon Sequencing Workflows - https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124671

#### Decision points in typical -Omics workflows:

* Initial data QA/QC
*   interpretation of phred scores, choosing quality cutoff, merging criteria (for Paired-End Illumina reads)
