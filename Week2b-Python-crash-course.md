Alejandro to populate - overview of Python as it relates to running -Omics pipelines

NOTE: we discussed introducing iPython (command line) and Jupyter notebooks here. But you should also at least show a python script (to introduce what the coee looks like), and talk about how to run example python scripts with the relevant flags (we can discuss what makes the most sense to run..someting name script.py would be best)
