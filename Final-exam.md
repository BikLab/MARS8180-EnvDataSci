#### Midterm Exam - Extra Credit (Optional)

To obtain +10 points on your *curved* midterm exam grade, you have the option to complete the following:

1. Using any of our class datasets and/or output files that you already have on hand, complete a short bioinformatics workflow + data visualization to analyze/visualize something we have NOT done in class. For example, you could use something like Blobtools (https://blobtools.readme.io/docs/my-first-blobplot) to visualize the taxonomy and read coverage of the different genomes in one of our single-worm metagenomics samples.
2. Write a short GitHub tutorial **specific to our dataset** - post in a GitHub repo similar to what we have done in class, with code blocks and explanations.

(NOTE: Your midterm exam grade will only be adjusted up to 100 points; for example, if you had a 92 exam grade after the curve and completed the extra credit, you would get 8 points to reach a grade of 100)
