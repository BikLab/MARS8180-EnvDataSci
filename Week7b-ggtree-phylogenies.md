### Week 7b Phylogenetic Visualizations using ggtree

One type of underutilized visualization in -Omics dataset is phylogenetic trees - you can easily build these with rRNA data (18S for eukaryotes / 16S for bacteria and archaea), and phylogenies will give you a lot of additional information about the evolutionary history of microbial assemblages.

Our favorite package is ggtree, and the supplemental package ggtree extra, software papers as follows:

An example ggtree figure from a recent Bik Lab paper focused on nematode microbiomes:
