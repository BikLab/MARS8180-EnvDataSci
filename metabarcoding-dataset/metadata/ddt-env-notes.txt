############### DDT metadata ###############

1- Variables associated with samples/fastq files
Sample_ID: represents the paired fastq file of a specific sample (biological sample). It contains additional information related to potential technical replicates (e.g., technical PCR replicates)
Sample: represent TRUE the biological sample of the study
PCR_Replicate: technical replicate at the PCR level
Sample_Control: column in the metadata to differentiate real samples (including positive controls) from blank samples and negative control samples (i.e., no DNA)
Sample_Type: it differentiates sample types (e.g., DNA, blanks, positive control, negative control)

2- Variables representing factors
Core_Fraction: sediment depth/fraction of biological samples (cm). Vertical community stratification
Barrel_Zone: distance from the DDT barrels (m)
Barrel_ID: barrel identification
Gear: sampling device to collect sediment samples (push cores with Remote Operational Vehicle (ROV) or multicore)
Site: specific sampling site related to DDT barrels or background sites
Site_Area: it differentiates between samples collected in the DDT area and outside
Bacterial_Halo: if sediment samples were/weren't collected in the bacterial mat

3- Station variables, water column variables, and nematode abundance
Depth: ocean depth (m)
Temperature: water temperature (C)
Salinity: ocean salinity (ppt)
Oxygen: oxygen concentration in the water (umolL-1)
Latitude: latitude in decimal degrees
Longitude: longitude in decimal degrees
Date: Sampling date
Nema_Count: nematode abundance per m2 (square meter)

4- Sediment Environmental Variables
DDT (ng/g): Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, pesticide
DDE (ng/g): Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, the breakdown product of DDT
DDD (ng/g): Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, a breakdown product of DDT
DDMU (ng/g): Dichlorodiphenylchloroethylene, the breakdown product of DDT
DDX (ng/g): Sum of DDT and its derivatives DDE, DDD, DDMU
PAHs (ng/g): Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
PCBs (ng/g): Polychlorinated Biphenyls 
TOM (%): Total Organic Matter
H2O (%): Water Content
Porosity (%): Sediment Porosity
Sand (%): Percent of Sand
Silt-Clay (%): Percent of Fine sediment
Chla: Sediment Chlorophyll a
Phaeo: Sediment Phaeopigments
CPE: Chloroplast Pigment Equivalents (Chla + Phaeo)
TOC %: Total Organic Carbon
TN %: Total Nitrogen
δ13CVPDB (‰): Stable Isotope of Carbon 13
δ15NAir (‰): Stable Isotope of Nitrogen 15
Chla_Phae: Chlorophyll a to Phaeopigments ratio (fresh OM)


5- Additional variables
Cruise: oceanographic cruise when samples were collected
Jensen_sampleID: specific laboratory sample ID (not useful for the data analysis)
Dive: ROV dive number
