### Metagenomic Data Analysis

#### Reminder: Midterm grading, Capstone project metadata / planning form due TODAY (fill out two docs with your name on them here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rVFjad6uNhVdYuQ6eLdxYDm65oUYDbWE?usp=drive_link

#### 11:10-11:20: Written Reflection

In what ways does metagenomic data differ from amplicon (e.g. 16S/18S rRNA) datasets? What are the advantages/disadvantages of metagenomic datasets? Take 5 minutes to jot down some thoguths here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCKfkQk5Hl0owHBzxY7mBf7Nk-fGh1F1Ngd7JNpo7Gg/edit?usp=sharing

Quince et al. (2015) review paper - http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3935 
* Good general overview of shotgun metagenomic pipelines, and how they are similar/different to rRNA metabarcoding approaches
* Slightly outdated in its description of sequencing technologies (many Illumina platforms mentioned are now discontinued, and long read technologies are now starting to become very cheap/common)
* Some updates in software tools - many of the "newer" or "automated" software mentioned in this paper are now very standard (e.g. CONCOCT, MetaBAT)

New & Brito (2020) review paper - http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-micro-012520-072314
* Gives some really good vignettes about the challenges of metagenomics, although many examples are very biomedical focused (e.g. human microbiome studies)
* _Just a single drop (0.4mL) of ocean water collected from the Sargasso Sea contained 6,236 genomes (average of 38% completeness)...less than 0.1% of the genomes were from the same species_ (Brito & New 2020)
